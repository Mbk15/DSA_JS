# Space Complexity

### NB : Auxilliary SPace complexity refer to the space required by the algorithim , not including space taken up by inputs.

## Space Complexity in JS

### 1. Most Primitives (booleans , numbers , undefined , null) take up constant space.

### 2.Strings require O(n) , where n is the length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects).

## Logarithms and Thumb Rule

Logarithm is the inverse of exponentiation.
log2(8) = 3 ; 2^3 = 8

### Thumb Rule for Log

The Logarithim of a number roughly measures the times you can divide a number by two(2) before you get a value that is less than or equal to one (1)
