# Big O Notation

### Big O Notation is a way to formalize fuzzy counting. It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of algorithim grows as the input grows.

## Big O Shorthands

### 1. Arithmetic Operations are constant.

### 2. Variable assignments are constant.

### 3. Accessing elements in an array by index or object is constant.

### 4. In a loop , the complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens inside the loop.
